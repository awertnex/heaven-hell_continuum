---- Entity vs Static Voxel ----------------------------------------------------

Using the AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) algorithm:
    Collision Check Region:
        A box around the entity is created the size of its base bounding box
        plus one unit (voxel) in each direction,
        collision checking happens only within this region.

        The box is "shrink-wrapped" encapsulating the entity's current position
        and its previous position,
        plus the size of its bounding box at both positions.

        The box is then floored and ceiled to snap to integer intervals.

    Voxel indexing:
        The start and end points of the collision check region are mapped to
        chunk coordinates relative to the entity's current chunk.

        Voxels inside the region are queried one by one in a loop,
        x, y, z iterators walk the span of the range normally
        (note that the starting index can be negative, meaning it can start in
        the neighboring chunk before the current chunk).

        dx, dy, dz (delta coordinates) iterators walk with x, y, z,
        but are restricted to range [0, CHUNK_DIAMETER - 1] and are used to
        index the voxels of a given chunk.

        dcx, dcy, dcz (delta chunk) iterators walk with x, y, z
        divided by CHUNK_DIAMETER to turn them into chunk delta-index.

    Collision Processing:
        Basic AABB collision
        ('https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_collision_detection'
        is a great resource) is performed on all six faces of both the entity's
        bounding box and a given voxel's bounding box.

        Once the intersection is corrected, the entity's bounding box position
        is also updated so the next voxels don't process outdated data.
