## Note About Versioning
**Before v0.4.0-beta, v0.4.0-dev used to be "development of v0.4.0-beta", after that v0.4.0-dev is "development after v0.4.0-beta".**

## Build From Source

>**NOTES:**
>- for release build, pass argument "release" into the build tool.
>- if build successful, you can place the built directory 'Heaven-Hell Continuum' anywhere you wish, that's the entire game.
