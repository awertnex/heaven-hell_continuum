### windows-specific:
- [w64devkit v2.4.0](https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit): not necessary for runtime, just for building from source


## Build From Source

>**NOTES:**
>- for development build, turn off `GAME_RELEASE_BUILD` in `src/h/main.h` (set as `0`), enables TRACE and DEBUG logging.
>- if build successful, you can place the built directory 'Heaven-Hell Continuum' anywhere you wish, that's the entire bundle.
>- the build tool will rebuild itself before building the project if you either have modified its source or didn't build it in C99.

### for linux x86_64:

1. clone and build:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/awertnex/heaven-hell_continuum.git
cd heaven-hell_continuum/
./build

# optionally, but has to be called before './build'
./build engine
```

2. run:

```bash
./Heaven-Hell\ Continuum/hhc
```

### additional build commands:

- `./build help`: show help
- `./build engine`: build engine; it places it into './lib/linux', run `./build` again to copy it to 'Heaven-Hell Continuum/lib/linux'
- `./build show`: show build command
- `./build raw`: show build command, raw

### for windows (using any C compiler, a suggestion is "gcc" from "mingw"): (it is very broken)

if you don't already have a C compiler:
- [w64devkit v2.4.0](https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit) (includes gcc toolchain)

1. clone and build:

```command
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/awertnex/heaven-hell_continuum.git
cd heaven-hell_continuum
./build.exe

# optionally, but has to be called before './build.exe'
./build.exe engine
```

2. run:

```command
`./Heaven-Hell\ Continuum/hhc.exe`.
```

### additional build commands:

- `./build.exe help`: show help
- `./build.exe engine`: build engine; it places it into './lib/win', run `./build` again to copy it to 'Heaven-Hell Continuum/lib/win'
- `./build.exe show`: show build command
- `./build.exe raw`: show build command, raw
